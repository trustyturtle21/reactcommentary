      <h1>Context</h1>

      <p>
        The goal is to learn how to develop an interactive interface,<br />
        use interface components,<br />
        and tie the components to an internal data state.<br />
        To get comfortable with React by creating a list-based interface!
      </p>

      
      <h2>Features to Include</h2>
      <p>
        At least 2 filtering categories<br />

        At least 1 sorting feature<br />
        An aggregator section on the same page displaying: Items you added to
        the aggregator<br />
        Aggregation of a property: total time, cost, votes, etc., but NOT the
        total number of items<br />
        At least 12 item cards, each displaying: <br />
        Item image<br />
        Categories that your filter uses<br />
        Field(s) that your sort uses<br />
        Property you are aggregating<br />
        A button that adds to/removes from the aggregator<br />
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Goal and Value of the Application</h3><br />
        the goal of the application is to browse anime through the sorting and
        filter options and be able to keep track of the anime that you have
        watched by adding to watchlist through the "Add to WatchList!" button
        <br >    <br />
        <h3>Usability Principles Considered</h3><br />
        My application should be able to handle
        any combination of filters, and all filters and sorting methods should
        work together without breaking the page <br />
        After Filtering there is an â€œAll" catagory to unfilter <br />
        After Sorting, there is an unsort Button <br />
        After adding to your watch list, there is a reset watch list button   <br >    <br />
        <h3>Organization of Components </h3> <br />
        AnimeCard is a component for each anime <br >    <br />
        <h3>How Data is Passed Down Through Components</h3><br />
        Data is passed down through components since there is a mapping function
        that goes through the json list and also passing in props, that is used
        to alter the current states <br >    <br />
        <h3>How the User Triggers State Changes </h3><br />
        The user triggers state changes by the clickable links and buttons
        States include totalWatchTime names genre season data
