      <h1>Context</h1>

      <p>
        The goal is to learn how to develop an interactive interface,<br />
        use interface components,<br />
        and tie the components to an internal data state.<br />
        To get comfortable with React by creating a list-based interface!
      </p>
      <h1>Features to Include</h1>
      <p>
        At least 2 filtering categories<br />

        At least 1 sorting feature<br />
        An aggregator section on the same page displaying: Items you added to
        the aggregator<br />
        Aggregation of a property: total time, cost, votes, etc., but NOT the
        total number of items<br />
        At least 12 item cards, each displaying: <br />
        Item image<br />
        Categories that your filter uses<br />
